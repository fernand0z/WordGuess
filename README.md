# WordGuess
A word guess game that uses constructor functions

# Instructions
Unfortunately, since this is a command line application, it must be cloned down to your machine to be demoed. After cloning down the repo to your computer, `cd` into the `Week11-Hangman` folder and run `npm install` to download all the node dependencies.

Once the node dependencies are installed, you can run the app by calling `node main.js` in your console.

The game will last for the duration of 1 word. After you either win or lose, the program exits. Run `node main.js` each time you wish to guess a new word.
